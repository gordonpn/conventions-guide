### Gitflow Workflow

The Gitflow was published and popularized by [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

In summary,

1. Master branch will only have high-quality code and only interacts with release branches.
2. Develop branch is forked from master.
3. Feature branches are forked from develop and merges back into develop.
4. When develop has enough features, a release branch is forked from develop.
    - Only bug fixes and documentation may be merged into release branches.
    - Release branches have the `release` token, e.g. `release/0.1.0` is a good release branch name.
    - When it is ready, the release branch is pushed with a tag name, such as `v1.2.3` where `1.2.3` follows [semantic versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/).
    - The release branch is merged into master and into develop.

5. Hotfix branches are used when there is an application-breaking bug in production (master).
    - The hotfix branch is forked from master, the fix is implemented and merged back into master as well as develop and current release branch if there is one.
    - Update the version tag of master.

#### Notes

As you are working on your feature or fix, stay up to date with the develop branch with `git pull --rebase`.

When your branch is ready for a merge, then clean up your commits with `git rebase -i`. Then, open a pull request to be reviewed.

### Git Feature Branch Workflow
