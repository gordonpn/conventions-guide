- A commit is one single _logical change_. Don't commit several logical changes, it ends up being harder to follow and understand.
- Use the interactive text editor to write meaningful commits `git commit` (omitting the -m).
- Commit often and early, but push less frequently (only when you're sure).

### Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and [Angular guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#).

To summarize,

```md
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

- All messages are always in present imperative tense. "change", not "changes" nor "changed".
- Always lowercase.
- Do not end sentences or phrases with periods.
- Types possible:

    ```md
    feat    feature
    fix     bug fix
    docs    documentation
    style   formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
    refactor
    test    when adding missing tests, or correcting
    chore   maintain
    build   affects build system or external dependencies
    ci      change to CI configuration and scripts
    perf    improves performance
    ```

- Scope is the scope in which the commit is related to. May be omitted.
- The body explains why, how and side-effects.
- Footer is where you may reference issues and make note of breaking changes.

    If there is a breaking change, it must be written in uppercase and the type must hav a `!`

    ```md
    refactor!: drop support for Java 8

    refs #134, #146
    BREAKING CHANGE: using new features of Java 13, must drop support for Java 8
    ```

### Reverting Commits

It might happen that we commit a change and push it to remote, but we need to undo it.

This calls for a revert `git revert HEAD`. This will open a text editor where you can write about why the commit needed to be reverted. When you're done, save and close the editor.
