## Test Driven Development

I believe TDD to be a great development process.

First, you write a test that will obviously fail (because you don't have any code yet).

Second, write some code to make that test pass.

Third, refactor as needed and repeat from step one.

## Refactoring

Before refactoring, write tests with near 100% coverage. With that, refactoring will be safer from producing bugs.

## Language Specific Conventions

Make sure to look up conventions and best practices related to your tech stack.

Here are some examples:

- [Node.js Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)
- [Express.js Production Best Practices](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html)
- [Naming Conventions for Golang Functions](https://www.golangprograms.com/naming-conventions-for-golang-functions.html)

## Project Structure

Some links I used myself:

- [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

Many ideas from the link above can be applied to projects of any language. Again, look up the conventions specific to the language that you are using.
